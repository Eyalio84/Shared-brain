# Changelog

Session-by-session narrative log for Shared Brain. Newest entry on top.

Every session (Claude, Gemini, any agent) appends an entry here at session end, following the schema in `AGENTS.md`.

`git log` is the *what* (immutable, machine-readable). This file is the *why* and the handoff instructions.

## 2026-04-24 16:30 — Proot Ubuntu validated; two runtime quirks fixed

**AI:** Claude
**Machine:** proot Ubuntu (Android, same device as Termux)
**State:** done
**Commits:** 06be461 (session close)

**What changed:**
- `package.json` — added `-H localhost` to the `dev` script. Without it, `next dev` crashes on proot with `uv_interface_addresses: Unknown system error 13` (EACCES on `os.networkInterfaces()`). With an explicit hostname, Next skips that lookup path entirely (see `next/dist/server/lib/start-server.js:289` — `hostname ?? getNetworkHost(...)`). Harmless on laptop/PC.
- `scripts/smoke.sh` — replaced the Termux-detection test. Old: `[ -d /data/data/com.termux ] && [ -z "$PROOT_ROOT" ]`. That failed in proot because (a) the termux directory is visible through proot's shared mount, and (b) proot-distro doesn't export `PROOT_ROOT`. New test: `[[ "${PREFIX:-}" == *com.termux* ]]`. `$PREFIX` is Termux's canonical marker and is unset inside the proot chroot.
- `package-lock.json` — npm on proot stripped `"libc"` arrays from optional-dep entries (added by Termux's npm). Normal cross-environment churn; committed so it doesn't re-churn next install.
- `HANDOFF.md` — deleted. Served its purpose as a one-shot Termux→proot bridge. A well-written CHANGELOG entry is sufficient for future inter-machine transitions; no reusable template needed.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — added an entry on the two proot runtime quirks and why we picked these fixes.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — "Known constraints" now mentions the proot `networkInterfaces` quirk.

**Why:** The prior session declared proot Ubuntu the runtime home but couldn't validate it. This session validated end-to-end: fresh clone into `/root/Shared-brain`, plain `npm install` (360 packages, 0 vulns), `npm run dev` serves HTTP 200 on `/` and `/api/commits`, `npm run build` completes cleanly (Tailwind v4 `lightningcss` loads fine — confirming the dlopen wall is a FUSE-storage thing, not Android-wide). Two real bugs surfaced and got fixed in-session: the proot `uv_interface_addresses` EACCES and the stale Termux-detection heuristic. Both fixes are minimal and platform-agnostic.

**Next:** n/a — complete. Proot runtime path is validated. Next session can land on any machine and follow the standard Session START ritual.

**Open questions:**
- Still open: should `Next:` be mandatory when `State: done`? (Carried from bootstrap. Lean toward "yes, even if just 'n/a — complete'" — gives future agents one fewer field to guess about.)
- Resolved: HANDOFF.md-as-template hypothesis — rejected. CHANGELOG entries are the handoff; no separate template file needed.

## 2026-04-24 14:00 — Platform scope decided; handoff to proot Ubuntu

**AI:** Claude
**Machine:** Termux (Android)
**State:** done
**Commits:** d4f5c0c (bootstrap), c1dbdf2 (session close)

**What changed:**
- `package.json` — reverted scripts to plain `next dev --webpack` / `next build --webpack`. The `node ./node_modules/next/dist/bin/next ...` form was a Termux-symlink workaround; no environment that actually runs the app needs it.
- `AGENTS.md` — added "Platform scope" section with a per-machine capability table. Termux declared edit-only.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — added the dlopen finding and the rationale for proot Ubuntu over (a) moving the project or (c) stripping Tailwind v4.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — expanded "Known constraints" with the dlopen note.
- `scripts/smoke.sh` — detects Termux and skips `npm run build` with a clear message; typecheck runs on all platforms.
- `README.md` — platform notes rewritten; Termux labeled edit-only; install flags explained.
- `HANDOFF.md` — NEW, temporary. Explicit context package for the next AI landing in proot Ubuntu. Deletes after successful validation (see its footer).

**Why:** Android's dynamic linker refuses to `dlopen` native `.node` libraries from `/storage/emulated/`. Our stack's `lightningcss` native module is unavoidable (Tailwind v4). Every `npm run dev` request returned 500. This is OS-level, not fixable via flags. User chose proot Ubuntu (same device, native ext4 namespace) over moving the project or downgrading the stack. Git remains the sync substrate — proot clones fresh from the same remote and runs normally.

**Next:** In proot Ubuntu, follow `HANDOFF.md` step-by-step: clone, `npm install` (plain), `npm run dev`, verify the Session Log viewer renders both CHANGELOG entries with state badges, verify `/api/commits` returns JSON. If both work, run `npm run build` to confirm production bundle. Then say "update docs" to record the validation and delete `HANDOFF.md`.

**Open questions:**
- Does the Session Log viewer actually render? First real UI validation — schema + parser correctness both ride on this.
- Should `HANDOFF.md` become a reusable template for future inter-machine transitions (e.g., laptop→PC, Claude→Gemini), or is it genuinely one-shot for this specific Termux→proot bridge?
- Carried forward: should `Next:` be mandatory when `State: done`?

## 2026-04-23 15:10 — Project bootstrap + Session Log viewer scaffold

**AI:** Claude
**Machine:** Termux (Android)
**State:** done
**Commits:** (initial commit — pending)

**What changed:**
- `package.json` — added `--webpack` flag to `dev` and `build` scripts (Termux/arm64 constraint).
- `AGENTS.md` — expanded from Next 16 stub into full shared agent instructions. Documents session protocol, CHANGELOG schema, turn-taking rule.
- `CLAUDE.md` — kept as Next 16 auto-generated `@AGENTS.md` import.
- `GEMINI.md` — added as thin pointer to `AGENTS.md` (explicit prose, not `@` import, for Gemini CLI compatibility).
- `README.md` — replaced default Next.js README with project-specific overview.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — file tree, module table, data flow for the Session Log viewer.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — rationale for AGENTS.md-as-SSOT, git-only sync, `in-flight` state field, `--webpack` flag.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file, initial entry.
- `scripts/smoke.sh` — typecheck + build sanity check.
- `app/page.tsx` — replaced default splash with Session Log viewer. Reads `CHANGELOG.md` via `node:fs`, parses entries, renders timeline with state badges.
- `app/api/commits/route.ts` — GET endpoint, shells out to `git log --oneline -20`, returns JSON.
- `app/layout.tsx` — updated metadata (title, description).

**Why:** First session establishes the rails. The protocol documented in `AGENTS.md` is now load-bearing — every future session depends on the schema and fields defined here. The viewer app is deliberately minimal: it reads the same files agents write, so dog-fooding reveals schema brittleness fast.

**Next:** User reviews the build in the browser, validates the schema by reading the viewer's rendering of this very entry. First handoff to Gemini CLI (on laptop) should follow the standard Session START ritual: `git pull`, read this entry, then proceed.

**Open questions:**
- Should `Next:` be mandatory when `State: done`? Currently allowed to be "n/a — complete". Leaving flexible until we see how it feels in practice.
- Should `Open questions` survive across entries (rolled forward until resolved), or does each entry stand alone? Currently each entry stands alone.

**Platform quirks encountered during bootstrap:**
- `npm install` without `--no-bin-links` failed (EACCES on symlinks) — documented in `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
- `npx tsc` pulls a wrong package from registry; direct node invocation (`node ./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc`) is the safe form on any platform.
- `create-next-app` skipped `git init` because parent `claude-projects/` is already a git repo. Required explicit `git init -b main`.
